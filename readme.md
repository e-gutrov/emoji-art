# Emoji Art Script

To run script put main.py, emojis_clear.txt, and cols_for_images.txt in the same dir.
Then:
* Run main.py
* Enter an absolute path to image. Tested extensions: jpg, png. But you can try others.
* Enter an absolute or relative path to output file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
* Open results with any text editor.

NOTE: output looks great only with white background color.
